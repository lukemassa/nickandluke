# nickandluke

Code for https://nickandluke.com/. Uses [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

## Development

`./run install`

`./run serve`

Then edit files, mostly in `app/src`.

## Deployment

`./run build`

This does a Vue build and puts the output in `docs/`.

It also keeps an old copy of js so any in-flight requests won't fail.
