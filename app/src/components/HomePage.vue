    <h1>nick & luke</h1>
    <p>
      We're so glad to celebrate our wedding with you next year.
    </p>
    <p>
     We met at a potluck dinner years ago here in Cambridge, and it feels right to bring all our favorite people together in this place where we've built our home and lives.
    </p>
    <p>
There will be information here regarding lodging, logistics, and more soon. But for now, we're so excited to see you at the Commander's Mansion in Watertown on October 1, 2022.
