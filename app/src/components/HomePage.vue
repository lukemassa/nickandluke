    <p>
      We're so glad to celebrate our wedding with you next year.
    </p>
    <p>
     We met at a potluck dinner years ago here in Cambridge, and it feels right to bring all our favorite people together in this place where we've built our home and lives.
    </p>
    <p>
There will be information here regarding scheduling, suggested activities, and more soon. But for now, we're so excited to see you at the Commander's Mansion in Watertown on October 1, 2022.
