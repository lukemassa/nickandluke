        <b><i>Arrival</i></b><br>
          If you’re flying into Boston Logan, the <b>MBTA’s Silver Line</b> is your best (and free!) bet to get into the city proper.
          Transfer to the <b>Red Line</b> is easy (and also, still free!) at <b>South Station</b>, and if you’re staying at the Charles Hotel,
          the Red Line’s <b>Harvard Square</b> stop is your destination. For our guests at the Hampton Inn & Suites looking for an easy
          transit option, you’re following the Charles Hotel directions to the Red Line’s <b>Central Square</b> stop, then hopping on the
          <b>#70 MBTA bus</b> all the way out to the Watertown Arsenal Mall. For those taking Amtrak into South Station, transfer to the T’s
          Red Line is also easy (but not free for train users, go figure).
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b><i>Friday Cocktail Reception</i></b><br>
        For Friday evening’s cocktail reception at the Charles Hotel, the best option if you’re not staying at the Charles or the Hampton
        Inn and Suites is the <b>Harvard Square</b> stop on the <b>T’s Red Line</b>. If you’re coming from the Hampton Inn and Suites, the <b>#70 MBTA bus</b>
        picks up right in the <b>Arsenal Mall</b> development, and is a quick transfer on <b>Western Avenue and Mackin Street</b> to the <b>#86 MBTA bus</b>,
        which takes you right into <b>Harvard Square</b>. The reverse is true for those trying to get from the Charles Hotel to the Commander’s
        Mansion or the Hampton Inn & Suites, either after the cocktail reception or on Saturday afternoon for the wedding and reception.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b><i>Saturday Ceremony and Reception</i></b><br>
        As mentioned above, the <b>#86 Bus</b> towards <b>Reservoir</b>, with a transfer to the <b>#70 Bus</b> at <b>Mackin Street and Western Avenue</b> and departure
        at the <b>Arsenal Mall</b> is your best bet if you’re staying at the Charles Hotel or elsewhere in Cambridge or Boston.
        There’s also ample parking for those who drove into town to park directly at the Commander’s Mansion on Saturday afternoon,
        and ride share apps like <b>Uber</b> or <b>Lyft</b> are also great (and recommended) options for those staying offsite.
        (The Commander’s Mansion is an easy walk from the Hampton Inn & Suites.)

        <b><i>Sunday Coffee and Goodbye</i></b><br>
        Our house in Inman Square is a 20 minute walk from the <b>Charles Hotel</b>, an easy T ride on either the <b>Green Line</b> at <b>Union Square</b>,
        or the <b>Red Line</b> at <b>Central Square</b> for those taking Amtrak at <b>South Station</b> or flying out of Logan Airpot. For those coming from the <b>Hampton Inn & Suites</b>, everyone’s favorite <b>#70 Bus</b> to <b>Central
        Square</b> is a straight shot, followed by an easy walk up Prospect Street to our house.
