      <li><b>What Pandemic Precautions Will Be In Place?</b>
      <br>We require that all guests be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and take an antigen or PCR test within 48 hours of the ceremony. Masks are welcome but not required.
      <p>The wedding ceremony and reception will be outside under a tent. The post-ceremony cocktail hour will be partially inside the mansion, and the after-party and Friday night welcome cocktails will be entirely inside the Charles Hotel.</p>
      <p>We recognize that conditions may change in the next few months, and will keep our guests up to date via this page as well as email. Feel free to <router-link to="/contact">reach out</router-link> in the interim if you have additional questions.</p>

      <li><b>Are Children Invited?</b>
         <br>We're lucky to have so many growing families among our nearest and dearest â€” but unless we've spoken to you directly, only adults are invited to the event.
         <p>Please do not hesitate to <router-link to="/contact">let us know</router-link> if this will present logistical challenges, and how we might be able to help.</p>
