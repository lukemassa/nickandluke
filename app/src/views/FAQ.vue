      <li><b>What Pandemic Precautions Will Be In Place?</b><br>We ask that all guests be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. We will also likely have a testing requirement, and will clarify as the date gets closer.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Are Children Invited?</b><br>We're lucky to have so many growing families among our nearest and dearest â€” but unless we've spoken to you directly, only adult are being invited to the event.<br>Please do not hesitate to let us know if this will present logistic challenges, and how we might be able to help.</li>
