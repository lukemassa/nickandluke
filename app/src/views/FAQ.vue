      <li><b>What Pandemic Precautions Will Be In Place?</b><br>We require that all guests be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and take an antigen or PCR test within 48 hours of the ceremony.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Are Children Invited?</b>
         <br>We're lucky to have so many growing families among our nearest and dearest â€” but unless we've spoken to you directly, only adults are invited to the event.
         <p>Please do not hesitate to let us know if this will present logistical challenges, and how we might be able to help.</p>
